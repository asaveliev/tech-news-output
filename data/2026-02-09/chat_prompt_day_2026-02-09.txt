Daily Tech Digest for 2026-02-09

Style instructions: You are writing a script for a short podcast. Write in a friendly,
engaging, and conversational tone suitable for a general tech-savvy audience. Use
contractions and a natural flow as if speaking directly to viewers.

Output three things in this order, details below:
 content sections
 video descriptions for youtube and tiktok
 html for starting slide 

CONTENT FILTERING: Skip stories that are primarily about:
- Politics, policy, or regulatory issues (unless directly impacting technical work)
- Media industry news, entertainment, or content creation
- Social issues, culture wars, or societal debates
- Business/finance news without technical substance
- Legal disputes or lawsuits (unless about significant technical precedents)

CRITICAL RULE: Base the script strictly on the information found in the provided article titles and snippets. 
Do not import details, specific exploit chains, or technical specifics from your internal training data or 
previous years' events (e.g., if covering Pwn2Own 2026, do not include details from Pwn2Own 2024). 
If a technical detail is not in the source, do not invent it.

CRITICAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOL (Apply before writing):
    VERIFY THE MECHANISM: Explicitly identify how the event occurred.
        Financial/Business: Is the "loss" a stock drop (market sentiment) or an operational loss (theft/outage)?
        Security: Is the "breach" a code exploit (hack) or a configuration error (leak)?
        Science: Is the "breakthrough" a peer-reviewed paper (lab theory) or a shipping product (reality)?
    VERIFY THE ACTOR: Who is taking the action?
        Do not attribute a community tool to a major corporation just because it's on their platform (e.g., a GitHub repo hosted by Microsoft vs. made by Microsoft).
        Do not attribute a commentary (blog post) to the creator of the software being discussed.
    VERIFY THE SCOPE:
        Is this a "universal" failure or a specific edge case?
        Distinguish between "The server is down" (fact) and "The company is dead" (speculation).
Before writing the script for each slide, extract 3 key technical facts actually present in the source text. 
Use only these extracted facts to write the script.

For recurring events (like Pwn2Own, DefCon, or product launches), verify that the specific details (e.g., "Gateway pivot", "M4 chip") 
are from the current year's coverage and not a hallucination of a past year's top story.

If an article discusses a concept, tool, or term (e.g., 'Gas Town', 'Vibecoding'), verify if the article is the primary source or a commentary. 
If it is commentary, explicitly attribute the original concept to its creator in the script (e.g., 'Maggie Appleton's analysis of Steve Yegge's Gas Town'). 
Do not present the commentator as the inventor.

Distinguish between 'newly released' tech and 'newly discussed' concepts. If a story covers an existing concept (rehashed or analyzed), 
frame the script as 'exploring [Concept] by [Creator]' rather than 'announcing [Concept]'.

Before writing, cross-reference the article author with the names mentioned in the text. 
If the text credits another person for the core idea (e.g. 'Steve Yegge's post'), ensure the script reflects that hierarchy.

Focus on stories about:
- New technologies, tools, frameworks, or programming languages
- Technical innovations, breakthroughs, or scientific research
- Software engineering practices, architecture, or methodologies
- Security vulnerabilities, exploits, or technical analysis
- Infrastructure, DevOps, cloud, or systems engineering
- Open source projects, developer tools, or technical communities
- Technical deep-dives, debugging stories, or engineering case studies
- AI/ML research, models, techniques, or applications
- Hardware engineering, chips, processors, or electronics
- Space technology, rockets, satellites, or exploration missions
- Robotics, automation, or manufacturing tech
- Networking, protocols, or internet infrastructure
- Cryptography, blockchain tech (not crypto prices/trading)
- Scientific computing, simulations, or data analysis
- Energy tech, batteries, solar, nuclear, or grid innovations

SELECTION & PRIORITIZATION:
This list contains more stories than will fit in the podcast (~5 minutes, ~10 stories).
Select the TOP 10 most compelling technical stories based on:
- Technical significance and innovation (not just popularity)
- Diversity of topics (don't pick 5 AI stories if there are other interesting topics)
- Relevance to working engineers (practical value over hype)
- Balance between sources (HN and Reddit have different user bases and score scales)
Do NOT just pick the highest-scored items - use editorial judgment.

Below is a list of URLs with source metadata. Select the best TECHNICAL stories and
generate text for each section of the script.
Each section should have:
- The title and URL (article link)
- A script to read aloud while showing the slide (conversational, 20-50 seconds)
- Reference notes section containing:
  - Source platform (Hacker News or Reddit subreddit)
  - Post date
  - Discussion URL (link to HN or Reddit comments)
  - Upvotes/points and comment count
  - Community Reaction (sentiment analysis - see below)
- No more than one URL per slide
- The output should be in a format suitable for slides (e.g., Markdown with clear
  slide breaks)
- Do not summarize or combine URLs; treat each as a separate slide
- STRICT GROUNDING: Write the script using only the facts present in the provided source text. 
  Do not "fill in" technical details (like specific exploit chains or versions) from your external knowledge, 
  as this often leads to conflating current news with past events (e.g., confusing 2026 hacks with 2024 hacks).
- Do not include meta commentary about the model, prompts, or debugging info.

DISCUSSION SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:
For each selected story, analyze the discussion at the provided Discussion URL and include:
- Overall sentiment (e.g., enthusiastic, skeptical, mixed, critical, supportive)
- Key themes or concerns raised by commenters
- Notable counterpoints or criticisms
- Any important technical insights from the community
Include this as a "Community Reaction" note on each slide. This helps viewers understand
how the tech community is responding to the news, not just what the news is.

IMPORTANT: The source metadata (discussion URL, upvotes, comments, source platform) is provided as
CONTEXT to help you understand the story's popularity and relevance. Include this
information as notes in your slide output, but DO NOT read it aloud in the script.
The metadata should appear as reference information on the slide.

Video description generation:
Output the YouTube and TikTok descriptions inside triple-backtick code blocks (```).
Do not render the text or links. I want to copy-paste the raw string.

For youtube
    short under 100 character video title including the date, in this format:
    main taglines | Daily Tech Digest <date>

    full description of what's covered in two sentences
    
    list of articles, separated by newlines
    For each article include 
     - Name of the segment for this article
     - URL
     - Hashtags that apply to this article

    overall hashtags on the bottom that apply to whole episode

For tiktok 
    main taglines | Daily Tech Digest <date>
    full description of what's covered in two sentences
    hashtags on the bottom


Starting slide generation:
At the end of the list, generate starting slide for the video using html using below format.
Don't go and list everything - make a title and a list of themes. Use emojis to start each item in the list
Use plain text markdown output using below template:
<!DOCTYPE html>
